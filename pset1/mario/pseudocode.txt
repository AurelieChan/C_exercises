1. In do while loop

    1. Prompt user to enter a number for the height
    2. Store the value in a variable called 'height'
    3. Check the condition for the loop:
        The height has to be an integer, superior or equal to 1 and inferior or equal to 8
        If true, leave the loop;
        otherwise, continue the loop.


2. In a for loop, run 'height' times

    1. Print the pyramid if conditions are met.
    2. To achive a pyramid, the number of # is the same as c, which is the row number.
    3. To allign it to the left side, we substract the number of # from the height and print spaces instead.
